The original data is based on an article titled "Dear Mona Followup: Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?" published on Aug 13, 2014 on fivethirtyeight.com.

The data itself is extracted from a 2010 research conducted by World Health Organization.

I aquired the data in Oct 2021 and the download link to the data repository can be found here: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/alcohol-consumption
There is a file named "drinks.csv", which is the basis of this task and it is also stored in current's repository Original_Data directory.
